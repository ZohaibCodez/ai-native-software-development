# Lesson 1: Understanding Decisions

## Opening Hook

Your favorite restaurant app needs to decide: Is it still open? Is it within your delivery radius? Should it show a discount? Every "yes" or "no" question a program answers is a decision. Programs don't just execute code in a line—they make choices based on conditions. This lesson teaches how programs think through decisions.

## Decisions Everywhere

Every app you use makes decisions, thousands per second. Your email app decides: Is this message spam? Your game decides: Did the player reach the goal? Your bank decides: Can this account withdrawal go through?

Here's the pattern: Every decision has a **condition** (a question) and an **action** (what happens if true).

**Real-world examples:**

- **Temperature control**: If room temperature > 72°F, turn on air conditioning
- **Game logic**: If player has key, unlock the door (else, show "need key" message)
- **Banking**: If account balance < 0, prevent withdrawal
- **Age verification**: If age >= 18, show age-restricted content

Your job in this lesson is to understand **how** programs test conditions so they can make decisions.

**💬 AI Colearning Prompt**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Describe 3 apps on your phone and one decision each app makes every day."

Notice how each example has a condition (test) and a result.

---

## True and False: The Foundation of Decisions

Every condition in programming evaluates to exactly one of two values: **True** or **False**. Nothing in between. When you ask a program "Is 5 greater than 3?" it answers True. When you ask "Is my name Bob?" (and it's Alice), it answers False.

These True/False values are called **Booleans** in programming (named after mathematician George Boole).

**Simple examples:**

```python
# Testing conditions - each evaluates to True or False
age: int = 17
can_drive: bool = age >= 16  # True (17 is greater than or equal to 16)

score: int = 72
is_passing: bool = score >= 70  # True (72 is greater than or equal to 70)

name: str = "Alice"
is_bob: bool = name == "Bob"  # False (name is not "Bob")

temperature: int = 82
is_hot: bool = temperature > 80  # True (82 is greater than 80)
```

Notice the pattern: Each comparison produces a **bool** (True or False).

**🎓 Instructor Commentary**

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize what operators do—you understand the INTENT. Your AI partner can always explain an operator. Your job: recognize "I need to test if this value is greater than that value" and let AI help with syntax.

## Comparison Operators: Tests That Return True or False

Python gives you six comparison operators—each tests a different relationship between two values:

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `>` | greater than | `5 > 3` evaluates to True |
| `<` | less than | `5 < 3` evaluates to False |
| `==` | equal to | `5 == 5` evaluates to True |
| `!=` | not equal to | `5 != 3` evaluates to True |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to | `5 >= 5` evaluates to True |
| `<=` | less than or equal to | `5 <= 3` evaluates to False |

Each operator **tests** a relationship and returns True or False.

**Worked examples:**

```python
# Test each operator
num1: int = 10
num2: int = 5

print(num1 > num2)   # True (10 is greater than 5)
print(num1 < num2)   # False (10 is not less than 5)
print(num1 == num2)  # False (10 is not equal to 5)
print(num1 != num2)  # True (10 is not equal to 5)
print(num1 >= num2)  # True (10 is greater than or equal to 5)
print(num1 <= num2)  # False (10 is not less than or equal to 5)
```

**With strings:**

```python
name1: str = "Alice"
name2: str = "Bob"

print(name1 == name2)  # False (different names)
print(name1 != name2)  # True (they are different)
```

## Code Examples

### Example 1A: Testing Comparisons with Numbers

```python
# Predict the boolean value before running
age: int = 25
temperature: int = 72
score: int = 95

# What will each of these be? (True or False?)
can_drink_alcohol: bool = age >= 21  # ? (True)
is_hot: bool = temperature > 80      # ? (False)
is_perfect_score: bool = score >= 95 # ? (True)

print(f"Age {age}, can drink? {can_drink_alcohol}")
print(f"Temperature {temperature}, is hot? {is_hot}")
print(f"Score {score}, perfect? {is_perfect_score}")
```

**Output:**
```
Age 25, can drink? True
Temperature 72, is hot? False
Score 95, perfect? True
```

### Example 1B: Predicting Boolean Results

Before you run code, predict what each comparison will produce:

```python
# Predict BEFORE running
x: int = 10
y: int = 20

# Predict True or False for each
print(x > y)   # ? (False - 10 is not greater than 20)
print(x < y)   # ? (True - 10 is less than 20)
print(x == y)  # ? (False - they're not equal)
print(x != y)  # ? (True - they're different)
print(x >= y)  # ? (False)
print(x <= y)  # ? (True)
```

Try running this and check your predictions. Did you get them all right?

## Practice Approach

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Create 5 comparison expressions that evaluate to True and 5 that evaluate to False. Then explain WHY each one is True or False."

Expected outcome: You'll strengthen your intuition about how comparison operators work.

**✨ Teaching Tip**

> Use ChatGPT or Claude Code to explore: "What does the operator `>` test? Give me 3 real-world examples where you'd use it." This builds your instinct before you need these operators in conditionals (next lesson).

## Try With AI

**Tool**: ChatGPT (ChatGPT web if Claude Code not yet installed)

**Prompts**:

1. **Recall**: "What does the `>` operator test? Give me 3 examples of when you'd use it."

2. **Apply**: "Write 5 boolean variables testing different comparisons (age, price, score, name, temperature). What value (True or False) will each have?"

3. **Analyze**: "Compare the `==` and `!=` operators. When would you use each one? Show with examples."

4. **Synthesize**: "If a program needs to check whether a student passed (score >= 70), which comparison operators could you use? Why?"

**Expected Outcomes**:
- You can explain what each comparison operator tests
- You can predict True/False results for simple comparisons
- You understand that conditions fuel decisions in programs
- You know which operator to use for different scenarios

**Safety/Ethics Note**: None specific to this lesson (no code execution yet). Focus on understanding the logic.
