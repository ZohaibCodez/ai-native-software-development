# Lesson 4: Nesting Conditions

## Opening Hook

To buy alcohol online: IF age >= 21 AND IF delivery is available to your address... This needs TWO conditions. Both must be true. This lesson teaches nesting for problems that need multiple conditions—one inside another.

## What is Nesting?

**Nesting** means placing an if statement inside another if statement. The inner if only tests IF the outer if is true.

**Syntax:**

```python
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # runs if BOTH condition1 AND condition2 are True
```

**Key points:**
- Inner if is indented inside the outer if's block
- Inner if only tests IF outer if's condition is true
- Both blocks are indented 4 spaces (outer) and 8 spaces (inner)

**Worked example: Eligibility for special discount**

```python
age: int = 25
has_coupon: bool = True

if age >= 18:              # First condition: Must be 18+
    if has_coupon:         # Second condition: Must have coupon
        print("Senior discount applied")
# Runs ONLY if BOTH conditions are True
```

---

## When to Use Nesting

Use nesting when you need **MULTIPLE conditions to ALL be true**. You're checking: "If this AND if that..."

**Example: Student discount (must be student AND part-time hours)**

```python
is_student: bool = True
hours_per_week: int = 15

if is_student:
    if hours_per_week < 20:  # Only check hours if is_student is True
        print("Student part-time discount: 20% off")
```

This reads as: "If student, then check if working part-time. If both true, give discount."

**Alternative approach: Using AND operator**

```python
# Same logic, different syntax
if is_student and hours_per_week < 20:
    print("Student part-time discount: 20% off")
```

Both approaches work. Nesting emphasizes the hierarchy: "First check if student, THEN check hours." AND is more concise. (You learned AND in Chapter 15.)

**💬 AI Colearning Prompt**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "When is nesting better than AND/OR operators? What makes code readable?"

This helps you choose the clearest approach.

## Indentation in Nesting: Visual Structure

Each level of nesting adds 4 more spaces of indentation. Visually, nested blocks are "deeper."

**Visual structure:**

```python
if condition1:                # 0 spaces - outer if
    if condition2:            # 4 spaces - nested if
        print("Both true")    # 8 spaces - nested block
```

**Another example:**

```python
age: int = 25
is_member: bool = True

if age >= 21:                # 0 spaces
    if is_member:            # 4 spaces (inside outer if)
        print("Member 21+")  # 8 spaces (inside nested if)
```

**WRONG indentation (doesn't nest):**

```python
# ERROR - second if at same level as first (not nested)
if age >= 18:
if has_coupon:
    print("Discount")
# Python doesn't see these as nested
```

**CORRECT indentation:**

```python
# CORRECT - nested if indented inside first if
if age >= 18:
    if has_coupon:
        print("Discount")  # 8 spaces = nested
```

**✨ Teaching Tip**

> Use Claude Code to understand nesting: "Trace this nested if code step-by-step. Which conditions run? Which are skipped?" This builds intuition.

## When Nesting Gets Complex: Time to Ask AI

Simple nesting (1 level) is fine to write yourself. But nesting gets hard to read quickly:

```python
# TOO COMPLEX - very hard to trace
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        if condition3:
            if condition4:
                # Which conditions matter?
                # Hard to understand!
```

**When you have 3+ conditions to test, ask AI:**

```
Ask your AI: "I need to check 4 conditions all at once. Should I nest them or use AND/OR operators?
Show me both approaches and explain when to use each."
```

Your AI will suggest the clearest option. Maybe AND is better. Maybe a mix of nesting and AND. Your job: understand the intent, let AI suggest syntax.

## Code Examples

### Example 4A: Simple Nesting

```python
# Check if eligible for a special offer
age: int = 25
is_member: bool = True

if age >= 21:  # First condition
    if is_member:  # Nested condition
        print("Member over 21: Premium offer available")
# Prints only if BOTH conditions are True
```

### Example 4B: Nesting with Else Blocks

```python
# Eligibility for student housing
is_student: bool = True
gpa: float = 3.5

if is_student:
    if gpa >= 3.0:
        print("Eligible for honors housing")
    else:
        print("Regular student housing")
else:
    print("Not eligible for student housing")

# Output: "Eligible for honors housing"
# Different branches based on both conditions
```

## Practice Approach

**🎓 Instructor Commentary**

> In AI-native development, you don't worry about nesting complexity—you ask AI "Is there a clearer way to write this?" Syntax is cheap; readability is gold. Simple nesting is fine. Beyond that, use AI to suggest the clearest approach.

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "I need to check if a user is both adult AND member. Show me nesting AND AND operator approach. Which is clearer? Why?"

Expected outcome: You understand when simple nesting is useful and when to ask AI for help with complexity.

## Try With AI

**Tool**: ChatGPT

**Prompts**:

1. **Recall**: "What does nesting mean? When would you use it? Give an example."

2. **Apply**: "Write a nested if that checks: if age >= 18, then check if has_license. Print appropriate message for each case."

3. **Analyze**: "Compare nested if vs AND operator. Show the same logic both ways. When is each better?"

4. **Synthesize**: "Create a nested condition for a real scenario (eligibility for something, access control, etc.). Explain why nesting makes sense."

**Expected Outcomes**:
- You can write one-level nested conditionals
- You understand nesting purpose and when to use it
- You know to ask AI when nesting gets complex
- You can compare nesting vs AND for readability

**Safety/Ethics Note**: None specific to this lesson.
