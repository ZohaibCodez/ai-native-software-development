# Lesson 2: If and Else

## Opening Hook

Your decision about what to wear depends on weather: IF it's raining, wear a jacket. ELSE, wear a t-shirt. Programs make decisions exactly this way. This lesson teaches the if/else pattern—how programs choose between two paths.

## If Statements: Taking One Path

The **if statement** lets a program execute code ONLY when a condition is true. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block is skipped entirely.

**Syntax:**

```python
if condition:
    # code here runs ONLY if condition is True
    # if condition is False, this entire block is skipped
```

**Key points:**
- `if` is the keyword that starts a conditional
- `condition` is a test (boolean expression) that evaluates to True or False
- The code inside the if block must be **indented** (4 spaces further than `if`)
- If the condition is False, the block is skipped

**Worked example:**

```python
age: int = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")

# If age is 20: prints "You can vote"
# If age is 16: nothing prints (condition is False)
```

Another example:

```python
temperature: int = 85
if temperature > 80:
    print("It's hot! Stay hydrated.")

# If temperature is 85: prints the message
# If temperature is 72: nothing prints
```

**💬 AI Colearning Prompt**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Trace this code step-by-step. What happens if age is 16? What if age is 25?"

This helps you understand the conditional logic before moving to if/else.

---

## Else Statements: The Alternative Path

The **else statement** provides a second path: "Otherwise (if the condition is False), do this instead."

**Syntax:**

```python
if condition:
    # code here runs if condition is True
else:
    # code here runs if condition is False
```

**Key points:**
- Exactly ONE path runs: either the if block or the else block, never both
- Both blocks must be indented 4 spaces
- else comes directly after the if block (no gap)

**Worked example:**

```python
score: int = 65
if score >= 70:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")

# Since 65 < 70, prints "Fail"
```

Another example:

```python
password: str = "secret123"
user_input: str = "secret123"

if user_input == password:
    print("Access granted")
else:
    print("Access denied")

# If they match: prints "Access granted"
# If they don't match: prints "Access denied"
```

**🎓 Instructor Commentary**

> In AI-native development, you don't need to memorize if/else syntax—your AI partner knows it. Your job: understand WHEN you need a binary choice (if/else). Is your decision "two possible paths"? Then if/else is right. Do you have three choices? Then you'll learn elif (next lesson). Syntax is cheap; decision logic is gold.

## Indentation: Python's Way of Marking Code Blocks

Python uses **indentation** (spaces at the beginning of lines) to mark which code belongs inside an if or else block. This is very different from languages like JavaScript that use curly braces `{}`.

**The rule:** Code inside an if/else block must be indented **4 spaces** further than the if/else keyword.

**CORRECT indentation:**

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")  # 4 spaces indented
    print("Can vote")  # 4 spaces indented
print("Done")  # No indent - outside the if block
```

**WRONG indentation (IndentationError):**

```python
# ERROR - no indentation
if age >= 18:
print("Adult")  # Python: "IndentationError: expected an indented block"

# ERROR - wrong indentation
if age >= 18:
  print("Adult")  # Only 2 spaces (should be 4)
```

**Visual check:** Look at the code. Is it indented 4 spaces further than the if? If yes, it's part of the if block. If no, it's outside.

**✨ Teaching Tip**

> Use Claude Code as a debugger: "I wrote an if/else but Python says IndentationError. Help me fix it." Indentation errors are VERY COMMON and completely fixable. Your AI tool can spot them instantly.

## Tracing If/Else: Reading Code Like a Computer

To predict what a program does, **trace** it:
1. Read the condition
2. Evaluate it to True or False
3. Execute the matching block
4. Skip the other block

**Worked example: Trace this code with different ages**

```python
age: int = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("Too young")
```

**Trace with age = 16:**
1. Condition: `16 >= 18` → False
2. If block is skipped
3. Else block runs → prints "Too young"

**Trace with age = 25:**
1. Condition: `25 >= 18` → True
2. If block runs → prints "You can vote"
3. Else block is skipped

Try tracing several examples to build your mental model of if/else.

## Code Examples

### Example 2A: Simple If/Else with Numbers

```python
# Check if eligible to vote
age: int = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible yet")

# Predict the output before running
age2: int = 15
if age2 >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible yet")
```

**Output:**
```
Eligible to vote
Not eligible yet
```

### Example 2B: Using Variables in Conditions

```python
# Check temperature and recommend clothing
temperature: int = 25
if temperature > 20:
    print("Wear light clothing")
else:
    print("Wear warm clothing")

# Now test with a cold temperature
temp2: int = 15
if temp2 > 20:  # Is 15 > 20? False
    print("Wear light clothing")
else:
    print("Wear warm clothing")
```

**Output:**
```
Wear light clothing
Wear warm clothing
```

### Example 2C: String Comparisons with If/Else

```python
# Check if password is correct
password: str = "secret123"
user_guess: str = "secret123"

if user_guess == password:
    print("Access granted")
else:
    print("Access denied")

# Try with wrong password
user_guess2: str = "wrong"
if user_guess2 == password:
    print("Access granted")
else:
    print("Access denied")
```

**Output:**
```
Access granted
Access denied
```

## Practice Approach

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Write a function that takes a test score (int) and returns 'Pass' if score >= 70, else 'Fail'. Include type hints. Then explain what the condition tests."

Expected outcome: You can write a simple if/else function from a plain English specification.

## Try With AI

**Tool**: ChatGPT

**Prompts**:

1. **Recall**: "What's the difference between if and else? When would you use each?"

2. **Apply**: "Write an if/else that checks if a number is even or odd. Include type hints. What condition tests 'is even'?"

3. **Analyze**: "Trace this code and predict the output: `score = 85; if score >= 80: print('good') else: print('okay')`"

4. **Synthesize**: "Create an if/else for a real decision (age check, eligibility, password check, etc.). Explain the condition and both paths."

**Expected Outcomes**:
- You can write if/else code with correct syntax and indentation
- You can predict program output by tracing code mentally
- You understand that if/else provides two possible paths
- You know why indentation matters in Python

**Safety/Ethics Note**: None specific to this lesson.
