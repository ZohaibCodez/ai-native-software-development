# Lesson 5: For Loops Basics

## Opening Hook

You need to print "Hello" 5 times. You could type 5 print statements... OR use a loop to repeat one print statement 5 times. Loops are Python's way of saying "do this action multiple times." This lesson teaches for loops—the simplest way to repeat code a known number of times.

## What is a Loop?

A **loop** is code that repeats the same action multiple times. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it once and tell Python "repeat this 5 times."

**Without a loop:**

```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
```

**With a loop:**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Both produce the same output, but the loop is much shorter and easier to change (what if you need 1-100 instead of 1-5?).

---

## For Loop Syntax: Repeating Code N Times

**Pattern:**

```python
for variable in range(start, end):
    # code repeats here
# code after loop
```

**Key parts:**
- `for`: The keyword that starts a loop
- `variable`: Name that changes each time (usually `i` or `num`)
- `range(start, end)`: Generates numbers from start to end-1
- Indentation: Code in the loop is indented 4 spaces (like if/else)

**Simple example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

**Why does it print 0-4 instead of 1-5?** `range(5)` means "start at 0, go up to (but not including) 5." This is called the "end is exclusive" rule.

---

## Understanding range(): The Loop Generator

`range()` is a function that generates a sequence of numbers. Understanding its parameters is key to writing loops.

### `range(end)` - Start at 0

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Prints: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

**Rule:** Start at 0, go up to (but not including) end.

### `range(start, end)` - Custom Start

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
# Prints: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

**Rule:** Start at start, go up to (but not including) end.

### `range(start, end, step)` - Count by Steps

```python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
# Prints: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```

**Rule:** Start at start, jump by step, stop before end.

### `range()` Backwards - Negative Step

```python
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)
# Prints: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

**Rule:** Start at 5, go backwards by 1, stop before 0.

**💬 AI Colearning Prompt**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Explain how range(5) works under the hood. How does Python know when to stop the loop?"

## Loop Variables: How They Change Each Iteration

The **loop variable** (usually `i`) holds a different value each time through the loop. It starts at the beginning value and increases by 1 (or step) each iteration.

**Tracing example:**

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")
```

**Iteration 1:** i = 1 → prints "Iteration 1"
**Iteration 2:** i = 2 → prints "Iteration 2"
**Iteration 3:** i = 3 → prints "Iteration 3"
**Loop ends** (because 4 is the end, not included)

**Tracing with calculations:**

```python
for num in range(1, 4):
    square: int = num * num
    print(f"{num} squared is {square}")
```

**Output:**
```
1 squared is 1
2 squared is 2 (wait, that's wrong... let me recalculate)
2 squared is 4
3 squared is 9
```

## Predicting Range() Output: Off-by-One Errors

A common beginner mistake is miscalculating what `range()` produces.

**Common mistake:**
- "I want 1-10" → Wrong: `range(1, 10)` gives 1-9 (not including 10)
- **Correct:** `range(1, 11)` gives 1-10

**Another mistake:**
- "I want to print 5 items" → Wrong: `range(5)` gives 0-4 (5 items, but starting at 0)
- **If you want 1-5:** Use `range(1, 6)`

**Pattern to remember:**
- `range(n)` produces 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 (total of n items)
- `range(1, n+1)` produces 1, 2, 3, ..., n (total of n items)

**🎓 Instructor Commentary**

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize range() parameters—you understand WHAT you're trying to repeat. Your AI partner knows the exact range syntax. Your job: recognize "I need to do this 10 times" or "I need numbers 1 to 5" and let AI help you write the range.

## Code Examples

### Example 5A: Simple Count with Range

```python
# Print 1 through 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

# Output:
# Count: 1
# Count: 2
# Count: 3
# Count: 4
# Count: 5
```

### Example 5B: Repeated Action (Loop Variable Not Used)

```python
# Print a message 3 times
for repetition in range(3):
    print("Welcome!")

# Output:
# Welcome!
# Welcome!
# Welcome!
```

### Example 5C: Using Loop Variable in Calculation

```python
# Print the square of numbers 1-5
for num in range(1, 6):
    square: int = num * num
    print(f"{num} squared is {square}")

# Output:
# 1 squared is 1
# 2 squared is 4
# 3 squared is 9
# 4 squared is 16
# 5 squared is 25
```

## Practice Approach

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Create a function that prints a multiplication table for a given number (e.g., 7×1 through 7×10). Use a for loop with range(). Explain what range() generates."

Expected outcome: You can write for loops with range() and predict loop output.

**✨ Teaching Tip**

> Use Claude Code to explore range(): "What does range(0, 10, 2) produce? What about range(10, 0, -1)?" This builds range intuition before complex patterns.
