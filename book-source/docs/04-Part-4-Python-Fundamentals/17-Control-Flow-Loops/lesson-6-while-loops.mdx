# Lesson 6: While Loops

## Opening Hook

A game loop: WHILE player hasn't reached the goal, keep playing. A password prompt: WHILE password is wrong, ask again. We don't know HOW MANY iterations—just "keep going until condition met." This lesson teaches while loops—the way to repeat code based on a condition, not a fixed count.

## While Loop Syntax: Repeat Until Condition is False

**Pattern:**

```python
while condition:
    # code repeats while condition is True
    # Condition MUST eventually become False or loop runs forever
```

**Key difference from for:** We don't know how many iterations in advance. The loop continues as long as the condition is True.

**Simple example:**

```python
count: int = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # CRITICAL: Change count toward 5, or infinite loop!
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

**Worked example: Count up from 0 until 5**

```python
count: int = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1  # Increment count each time
# Condition becomes False when count reaches 5
```

---

## When to Use While: Variable Iterations

Use **for** when you know the count in advance. Use **while** when you don't.

**For loops (known count):**
- Repeat 10 times
- Process items 1 to 100
- Count from 5 down to 1

**While loops (unknown count):**
- Keep asking for password until correct (don't know how many tries)
- Process items in a list until empty (don't know list size)
- Roll dice until you get a 6 (don't know rolls needed)

**Comparison table:**

| Pattern | Loop Type | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| "Repeat N times" | for | `for i in range(10):` |
| "Keep going until..." | while | `while password != correct:` |
| "Process while..." | while | `while items_remain():` |

**💬 AI Colearning Prompt**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Why would a program need a while loop instead of a for loop? What's the difference in when you know the iterations?"

## INFINITE LOOP DANGER: The Critical Concept

**CRITICAL:** If the condition in a while loop never becomes False, the loop runs forever. The program freezes, uses CPU, never stops.

**Cause of infinite loops:** Forgetting to change the variable that the condition tests.

**Example of infinite loop:**

```python
# INFINITE - count never changes!
count: int = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    # Missing: count += 1
    # count stays 0 forever, condition is always True
```

**Fixed version:**

```python
count: int = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Now count increases toward 5
    # When count reaches 5, condition becomes False, loop stops
```

**The question to ask yourself:** "What changes the condition toward False?"

Another infinite loop example:

```python
# INFINITE - x never changes
x: int = 10
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    # x stays 10, condition always True → INFINITE

# FIXED - x decreases
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1  # x gets smaller toward 0
```

**🎓 Instructor Commentary**

> In AI-native development, avoiding infinite loops is YOUR responsibility. AI can help you debug, but you need to think: "Does my loop have a path to termination?" If you're unsure, ask AI before running.

---

## Using AI to Check for Infinite Loops

When writing a while loop, ask your AI:

```
Ask your AI: "Check my while loop for infinite loop risk. Will this condition eventually become False?"
```

**Example AI collaboration:**

```
User: "I wrote: while score < 100: print(score). Will this terminate?"

AI: "No—score never changes inside the loop, so it's infinite.
    You need to add score += something inside the loop."
```

This is a safe way to verify your logic before running potentially infinite code.

**✨ Teaching Tip**

> Use Claude Code to explore infinite loops SAFELY: "Show me an infinite while loop and how to fix it." AI teaches the pattern without actually running it forever.

## Code Examples

### Example 6A: Simple While Loop with Increment

```python
# Count up from 1 to 5
count: int = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # ESSENTIAL: Change count toward termination

# Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (then stops)
```

### Example 6B: While Loop with Condition Change

```python
# Keep summing until total reaches 20
total: int = 0
number: int = 1

while total < 20:
    total += number  # This changes the condition
    print(f"Number: {number}, Total: {total}")
    number += 1

# Output shows how total grows toward 20, then stops
```

### Example 6C: For vs While Comparison

```python
# FOR loop - we know the count (0-4)
print("FOR loop:")
for i in range(5):
    print(f"For: {i}")

# WHILE loop - same effect, but condition-based
print("WHILE loop:")
count: int = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"While: {count}")
    count += 1

# Both print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
# Use for when count is known; use while when count depends on condition
```

## Practice Approach

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Write a while loop that keeps asking a user for a number until they enter a number >= 10. Include type hints. How does this prevent infinite loops?"

Expected outcome: You understand while loops, recognize infinite loop risk, and use AI to verify safety.

## Try With AI

**Tool**: ChatGPT

**Prompts**:

1. **Recall**: "When would you use while instead of for? What's the difference between knowing iterations in advance vs knowing a condition?"

2. **Apply**: "Write a while loop that counts from 10 down to 1. Include the increment/decrement that prevents infinite loops."

3. **Analyze**: "Is this an infinite loop? `while x > 0: print(x)` Why or why not? What's missing?"

4. **Synthesize**: "Create a while loop for a real scenario (validation, processing until complete, etc.). Explain how the condition eventually becomes False."

**Expected Outcomes**:
- You can write while loops with safe termination conditions
- You recognize infinite loop patterns
- You know to ask AI for safety verification
- You understand when while is better than for

**Safety/Ethics Note**: "Infinite loops are dangerous in production code. Always verify your while conditions will eventually become False. If unsure, ask your AI before running."
