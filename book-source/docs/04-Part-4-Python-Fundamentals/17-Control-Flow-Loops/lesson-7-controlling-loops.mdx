# Lesson 7: Controlling Loops

## Opening Hook

Searching for someone in a crowd: When you find them, you BREAK (stop searching). Checking for errors: You CONTINUE past valid items to find invalid ones. **break** and **continue** give you fine-grained control over loop behavior. This lesson teaches how to exit loops early or skip iterations.

## Break Statement: Exit the Loop Immediately

**break** stops the entire loop. No more iterations. The loop ends.

**Syntax:**

```python
for i in range(10):
    if condition:
        break  # Exit loop, skip remaining iterations
    print(i)
```

**Key points:**
- break exits immediately when the condition is true
- All remaining iterations are skipped
- Code after the loop continues normally

**Common use:** Searching. Once you find what you're looking for, stop searching.

**Worked example: Find first even number**

```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:  # Found an even number
        print(f"First even: {num}")
        break  # Exit loop, no need to keep checking
# Output: "First even: 8" (stops here, doesn't check 9 or 10)
```

---

## Continue Statement: Skip to Next Iteration

**continue** skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next one. The loop keeps running.

**Syntax:**

```python
for i in range(10):
    if condition:
        continue  # Skip rest of this iteration, go to next
    print(i)  # Only prints if condition was False
```

**Key points:**
- continue skips the rest of the loop body
- The loop variable still advances
- The loop continues to the next iteration

**Common use:** Filtering. Skip invalid items, process only valid ones.

**Worked example: Print odd numbers only**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Is it even?
        continue  # Skip it, go to next number
    print(i)  # Only prints odd numbers
# Output: 1, 3, 5 (skipped 2 and 4)
```

## Break vs Continue: How to Choose

**break**: Stop the entire loop
- Use when: "I found what I was looking for" or "Stop processing"
- Result: Loop ends immediately

**continue**: Skip this iteration, continue looping
- Use when: "This item isn't valid, skip it" or "This doesn't meet criteria"
- Result: Loop keeps going with next item

**Decision framework:**

```
Question: Do you want to STOP the entire loop?
  YES → use break (exit completely)
  NO → use continue (skip this item, keep looping)
```

**Comparison:**

```python
# BREAK: Search for something, stop when found
for item in items:
    if item == target:
        print("Found!")
        break  # Stop searching

# CONTINUE: Process items, skip some
for item in items:
    if item is invalid:
        continue  # Skip to next item
    process(item)  # Only processes valid items
```

**💬 AI Colearning Prompt**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "When you have a loop, how do you decide: Do I need break, continue, or neither?"

## Code Examples

### Example 7A: Using Break to Find First Match

```python
# Find first element divisible by 5
numbers: list[int] = [3, 7, 15, 20, 10]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 5 == 0:
        print(f"First divisible by 5: {num}")
        break  # Exit loop once found

# Output: "First divisible by 5: 15" (stops here)
```

### Example 7B: Using Continue to Filter

```python
# Print odd numbers only
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Skip even numbers
        continue
    print(i)  # Only odd numbers print

# Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

### Example 7C: Break and Continue Together

```python
# Process valid numbers, stop at 0
numbers: list[int] = [5, 2, -1, 8, 0, 3]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 0:
        print("Reached 0, stopping")
        break  # Exit loop
    if num < 0:
        continue  # Skip negative numbers
    print(f"Processing: {num}")

# Output:
# Processing: 5
# Processing: 2
# Processing: 8
# Reached 0, stopping
```

## Practice Approach

**🎓 Instructor Commentary**

> In AI-native development, you understand the INTENT (stop here vs skip this). Your AI partner handles the exact break/continue syntax. Your job: think clearly about what you want the loop to do.

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Write a loop that processes a list of numbers: skip negatives (continue), stop at 0 (break). Explain when each runs."

Expected outcome: You can use break/continue appropriately and explain the difference.

**✨ Teaching Tip**

> Use Claude Code to trace break/continue: "Show me this loop with break. Which lines execute? Which are skipped?" This builds intuition.

## Try With AI

**Tool**: ChatGPT

**Prompts**:

1. **Recall**: "What's the difference between break and continue? What does each one do?"

2. **Apply**: "Write a loop that prints 1-10 but skips even numbers (continue). Then modify it to stop at 5 (break)."

3. **Analyze**: "Trace this code and predict output: `for i in range(5): if i==2: continue; print(i)`"

4. **Synthesize**: "Create a real-world loop using break or continue (search, filtering, validation, etc.). Explain why you chose break or continue."

**Expected Outcomes**:
- You can use break and continue correctly in loops
- You understand the difference and when to use each
- You can explain loop control flow and when statements execute
- You can apply break/continue to real problems
